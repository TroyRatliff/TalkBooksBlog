# TalkBooksBlog

	I decided to create a blog website about books. Once completed with the front-end and back-end it 
	would be a typical blog where people count talk and recommend each other books. For my capstone 
	project my main concern is to focus on the back end but still give it enough front-end to interact 
	with. 

	FEATURES LIST:
- Add comments to your code explaining how you are using at least 2 of the solid principles

- Create a list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

- Query your database using a raw SQL query, not EF

-  Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format


	I used the built in sql server on visual studio 2022 to add data to my tables.

	Created controllers to interact with my models and my views.


	All my code is on the master branch and not the main.
